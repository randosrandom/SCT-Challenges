# Report folder
It contains a short report on the model we adopted to tackle the problem.

# Data folder
It contains the raw data for each region stored in **dpc-covid19-ita-regioni.csv**. There is also
a script **update_data.py**, which automatically connects to the internet and updates **dpc-covid19-ita-regioni.csv** with new statistics.

# Scripts folder
- Here you can find the *jupyter notebooks* with our models. In particular, the main notebooks are **RNN_Lombardia.ipynb**, **RNN_Lazio.ipynb**, **RNN_Sicilia.ipynb**, where we implemented the *Recurrent Neural Networks*, one for each region of interest. The notebook **Create_csv_assignment.ipynb** create the data-frames for the submissions.
- There is also another folder *Submission* where we saved our submissions, with the correspondent code and predictions.
